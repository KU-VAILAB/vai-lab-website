### Welcome to Vision & AI Lab @ Korea University!

The Vision & AI (VAI) Lab advances state-of-the-art artificial intelligence by rethinking the role of data. Our mission is to tackle diverse challenges in areas such as computer vision, multi-modal learning, and generative AI by exploring how data can fuel advances in AI. From a data-centric standpoint, our research interests include data-efficient learning (self-supervised, weakly supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning), transfer learning, and synthetic data generation. We strive to advance AI systems that can learn effectively from limited or imperfect data, and to develop innovative methods that push the boundaries of what is possible through data-driven approaches.

We are currently looking for undergraduate interns, master’s, and Ph.D. students. We welcome self-motivated students who enjoy identifying and solving problems independently. If you are interested, please contact Jungbeom (jbeomlee@korea.ac.kr) with your CV and transcript. We look forward to collaborating with you in our research journey!
